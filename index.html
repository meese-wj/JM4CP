When physics students learn how to use them to help solve problems, they may appeal to legacy examples in high-level languages like Python and MATLAB, especially if they don&#39;t have any prior programming experience. If they do, or maybe if they happen to be pretty brave, they may jump into something like Java, or low-level languages like Fortran, C, or C&#43;&#43;.</p> <p>The higher-level languages are usually pretty attractive because they&#39;re simpler to write code in than the lower-level ones, again especially for students with little programming experience. But the tradeoff is that they are normally <em>slow</em> &#40;cough-cough Python&#41;, so any time the student wants to build a big project and really push the boundaries of simulated science, they fail to get the job done. We then normally hold our noses and go for the lower-level languages, become initially enamored with their speed and eventually frustrated with their complexity &#40;looking at you, C&#43;&#43;&#41;. Most of us who do heavy-duty simulations on supercomputing clusters then have to worry about portability of libraries, environments, and other nauseating nuances that all distract from the thing we actually wanted to study: <em>physics</em>.</p> <p>The Julia programming language is an attempt to reduce this overhead for programmers, especially those of us with no formal computer science training. It strives to be as simple as a high-level language while keeping pace with the low-level ones. It&#39;s made to be used <em>interactively</em> like Python or MATLAB while reaching the speeds of a <em>compiled</em> language like Fortran or C. It really is quite a stunning tool that I personally think <em>all</em> physicists&#39;s should learn.</p> <p>The downside?</p> <p>Julia is <em>young</em>. So it does not have nearly as much documentation and help as a language like Python &#40;even though it really does have quite a bit&#41;.</p> <p>Julia is <em>different</em>. Most project design patterns physicists learn are either how to write scripts that can&#39;t be maintained in the long-run, or how to write code bases according the the <em>Object-Oriented Programming</em> paradigm. Julia can be scripty, but it is certainly not an object-oriented language. So for most of us, the maintainability patterns based on an abstract type hierarchy with multiple-dispatch seem foreign and too difficult to implement.</p> <p>But once you get it, Julia is <em>beautiful</em>.</p> <h2 id=purpose ><a href="#purpose" class=header-anchor >Purpose</a></h2> <p>This website serves as my repository of notes and tutorials on how to use <em>Julia Methods for Computational Physics</em> &#40;JM4CP&#41;. It&#39;s a work in progress, but I plan to cover all sorts of incredibly useful tricks the Julia has up her sleeve that will help you, the reader, do better computational science. </p> <p>I also will prove to you that while Julian design practices may seem crazy compared to ones we&#39;re used to, they are very natural extensions to how we, as physicists, organize abstract and concrete concepts in our everyday lives.</p> <h2 id=tutorial_links ><a href="#tutorial_links" class=header-anchor >Tutorial Links</a></h2> <p>These notes and tutorials are always accessible from the navigation pane in the upper-left corner of the screen.
